# Module-5
In this challenge I was able to parctipate in the anaylsis of pharameticals effects on rats. The study involved 249 mice with SCC tumors, treated over a period of 45 days. This repository contains code used to generate tables and figures for the technical report on this clinical study. The final report will summarize the performance of Capomulin in comparison to other treatments, highlighting efficacy based on tumor volume reduction and other metrics. I created box plots, line charts and a pie charts to represent the information that I found and how it effects the groups of rats.
